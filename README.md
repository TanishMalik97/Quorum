🚀 Introducing Quorum – A Dynamic Social Sharing Platform! 🌍

I’m thrilled to share Quorum, a full-stack web application designed for users to express their thoughts and interact with a community. This project helped me explore Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS, focusing on backend development, database handling, and user-friendly UI rendering.

🔥 Key Features:
✅ Post Creation & Management – Users can create, edit, and delete posts seamlessly.
✅ Dynamic Routing & RESTful APIs – Efficient request handling using Express.js.
✅ MongoDB for Data Persistence – Stores user data and chat history securely.
✅ EJS Templating for UI – Ensures a smooth and structured frontend experience.
✅ CRUD Operations – Full control over posts and messages.
✅ Real-time Chat Module – Users can send and receive messages using a MongoDB-powered chat system.

🎯 Tech Stack Used:
🟢 Backend: Node.js, Express.js
🟢 Database: MongoDB, Mongoose
🟢 Frontend: HTML, CSS, EJS
🟢 Authentication & Middleware: Express Middleware, UUID for unique IDs

This project has been an amazing journey in full-stack development, giving me hands-on experience with server-side logic, database integration, and routing. I plan to enhance Quorum with user authentication, real-time chat using WebSockets, and a refined UI.

💡 Looking for feedback and collaboration opportunities! Let’s build and grow together. 🚀
